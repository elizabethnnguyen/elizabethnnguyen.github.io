<!-- "alt" is description for image -->
<!-- <img src="../assets/staticBG.jpg" alt=""> this is another way adding images in because sometimes the link of your actual image can break. So climbing the tree for an image would be more beneficial.  -->
<!-- img tag is weird because there is an opening for the tag but theres not closing tag. You have to self close the tag yourself. </img> -->
