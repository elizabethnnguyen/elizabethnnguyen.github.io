<h1>ARTIST STATEMENT:</h1>

<br><p>My name is Elizabeth and this is my portfolio. At this moment, much of my work will consist of projects I've done for the classes I have taken thus far. However, I have been recently working on some personal works on the side, including more digital collages, digital illustrations, and some photography. Although I am keeping myself busy with these smaller pieecs, I have been more focused on another skill that I believe should come in handy in the long-run. I am currently taking on a minor in Computer Science, hoping that I will be able to develop some programming skills to which I may then incorport my art with. So far, I have grown very fond of coding-or more specifically, web design-and I have enjoyed learning about processing and p5 altogether. From this, I hope to be able to take on and create more interactive, but complex works of art in the future as well.
<br>
<br>As an artist, one of the most important elements I would consider includes being able to express my own individuality by means of concept or simply through artistic style. Digital art has always fascinated me and because there are many different options out there, it's hard to say which I prefer. Thus, this website is a sort of a diary that will show my journey as a developing artist.
