<h1>MY STATEMENT:</h1>

<br><p>My name is Elizabeth and this is my portfolio. At the moment, much of my work will consist of projects I've done for the classes I have taken thus far. These pieces include video shooting and editing, digital collages and prints, 3D modeling, net art with processing, and some photography. Although varied, most of my works were based on or influenced by personal experience and by a personal interest in new media technologies. I am fascinated by the idea of the digital world inconspicuously blending into the physical, so I like to leave a digital imprint on any work of art I create. Nonetheless, over the past year, I've grown very fond of web development and plan to continuously improve this portfolio as I progress. I want to make more websites, so I do plan on creating fake company websites to practice. I am currently studying Java in order to improve my development skills.
<p></p>
<br>As an artist, one of the most important elements I would consider includes being able to express my own individuality by means of concept or simply through artistic style. Digital art has always fascinated me and because there are many different options out there, it's hard to say which I prefer. Thus, this website will be a diary that will show my journey as a developing artist.
