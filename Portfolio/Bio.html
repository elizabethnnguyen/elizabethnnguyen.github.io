              <p>Although varied, most of my works were based on or influenced by personal experience and by a personal interest in new media technologies. I am fascinated by the idea of the digital world inconspicuously blending into the physical, so I like to leave a digital imprint on any work of art I create.<br><br>Much of my work consists of a variety of digital mediums. These include video shooting and editing, digital collages and prints, 3D modeling and animation, net art with processing and p5, and some photography works. Nonetheless, over the past year, I've grown very fond of web development and plan to pursue it as a professional career. In practice, creating mock-up company websites will help me achieve my goal and allow me to gain more insight to this type of work. Though my interest is sparked with web-development, that does not mean I will leave my other skills behind. In fact, I want to incorporate what I know into web development as much as I can. Video shooting and editing, 3D modeling and rendering, and photography can be incorporated as design elements to websites.<br><br>I am always looking for ways to improve my art and my skills. The internet is a significant source for interacting, learning, and expanding. There are many forums that I’ve come across where other artists or engineers help each other in terms of creating new projects in collaboration with each other or to simply help troubleshoot technical problems. There are also a lot of open source material and tutorials, as well as non-profit educational organizations that offer guidance for improvement.<br><br>As an artist, one of the most important elements I would consider is being able to express my own individuality by means of concept or simply through artistic style. Digital art has always fascinated me and because there are many different options out there, it's hard to say which I prefer. Thus, this website will be a diary that will show my journey as a developing artist.
