      <p>This arrangement brings light into the fact of just how much pop culture media can causally redirect attention away from social issues that should be attended to, such as poverty and homelessness. In contrast with the homeless encampment set-up, the footage of famous reality T.V. stars celebrating their wealth or complaining about their first world problems not only exaggerates but also emphasizes the sad reality of how those who are in poverty or those on the streets can be easily forgotten or ignored with materialistic performances, such as television. The two conflicting sides can both relate back to the title, "Dependency," as those who live a more wealthy lifestyle is dependent on their overall status and wealth, whereas those who are homeless are dependent on things as simple as blankets, cardboard, or simply warmth}</p>
