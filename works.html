  <h1>DOCUMENTED WORKS</h1>
  <p>Welcome to Eliz's portfolio. All work is original.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p class="artiststatement">Artist's statement: My name is Elizabeth and this is my portfolio. As an artist, one of the most important elements I would consider includes being able to express my own individuality by means of concept or simply through artistic style. Digital art has always fascinated me and because there are many different options out there, it's hard to say which I prefer. Thus, this website is a sort of a diary that will show my journey as a growing artist. <br> </p>

      <h2>"Disposal"</h2>
      <h3>Digital Video, 2 min, 2018</h3>
      <p>This heavily edited video can be interpreted differently depending on the person. However, the intial concept was to focus on environmental damage caused by human inhabitants. As the video progresses and more trash is being seen, the visuals and audio worsen, almost mimicking death.</p>

  <h2>"Dependency"</h2>
  <h3> Installation with Digital Video, cardboard, blankets, plastic tarp, bamboo sticks, 2018</h3>
  <p class="edit-description">This arrangement brings light into the fact of just how much pop culture media can causally redirect attention away from social issues that should be attended to, such as poverty and homelessness. In contrast with the homeless encampment set-up, the footage of famous reality T.V. stars celebrating their wealth or complaining about their first world problems not only exaggerates but also emphasizes the sad reality of how those who are in poverty or those on the streets can be easily forgotten or ignored with materialistic performances, such as television. The two conflicting sides can both relate back to the title, "Dependency," as those who live a more wealthy lifestyle is dependent on their overall status and wealth, whereas those who are homeless are dependent on things as simple as blankets, cardboard, or simply warmth</p>

    <h2>"WatchIt!"</h2>
    <h3>Website with multiple Digital Videos, montage of YouTube videos, 2018</h3>
    <p>The goal of this work is to sell Internet videos to viewers by mocking up an online shopping website. This not only emphasizes the very idea of how much time people spend watching videos on the Internet, but also highlights the kind of content that is being watched. <a href="WatchIt/index.html">Click here!</a></p>
